firstly in the cataloge 

- we set up an  empty cart
- we call this method to put all of the busmall options ,,we tried alot but i think these one areen solved it .
we thougt we have to call the name from the array after we creat an element option .


the second one the recuerd in it ,,, that we  need to add the selected item to the cart
 object, save the whole thing back to local storage and update the screen
 its took some time because selly error that we have put to **let** to the same function .
